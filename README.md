# CX Lab Code Test
The task is to create a navigatable carousal that launches a video behind the carousal. You'll use HTML/JavaScript/CSS to complete the task.

## Assets/Resources
You'll find the images and videos under the ```resources``` folder

## Expected Output
* The output should be a .html file that when presented at 16:9 is rendered edge-to-edge
* No external libraries
* Navigation of carosel elements should be clickable as well as being able to use the left/right/enter keyboard keys
* A 2 pixel, white border should highlight the active element
* The first element should be highlighted by default
* Element 3 should launch D3.mp4 behind the carousal
* When using the keyboard, you should *not* be able to loop around to the start of the carousal when reaching the end
* You may organize newly created files as you see fit, but please keep the ```resources``` folder intact

# CX Lab Code Test
* The task is to create a navigatable carousal that launches a video behind the carousal
* You'll use HTML/JavaScript/CSS to complete the task.
* Fork this repo to your own GitHub account

## Assets/Resources
You'll find the images and videos under the ```resources``` folder

## Expected Output
* The output should be a .html file that when presented at 16:9 is rendered edge-to-edge
* No external libraries
* Navigation of carousal elements should use the left/right/enter keyboard keys
* A 2 pixel, white border should highlight the active element
* The first element should be highlighted by default
* Elements should launch the corresponding video behind the carousal
* Should run only in the latest version of Chrome on the desktop (either Mac or Windows, you don't have to do both)
* When using the keyboard, you should *not* be able to loop around to the start of the carousal when reaching the end
* You may organize newly created files as you see fit, but please keep the ```resources``` folder intact
* The elements should *not* fit on the screen so that when you navigate to the right, they animate into view
